Digit Combination Generator

This program generates all possible combinations of a given number of digits and saves them to a file named 'combinations.txt'.

Usage:
1. Run the script using Python: python script.py
2. Enter the desired number of digits when prompted.
3. The combinations will be saved in 'combinations.txt' in the same directory.

Example:
If you enter '2', the file will contain:
00
01
02
...
98
99

Note:
The output file size increases rapidly with more digits, so use with caution for large numbers.
